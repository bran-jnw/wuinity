# WUINITY

Under-development tool called WUI-NITY, combines pedestrian and traffic evacuation/simulation in combination with wildfire spread simulation.

To function you will need the following things:

- OSM data for region of interest from https://www.geofabrik.de/ (or any other source)
- external_data folder with defaults (is packed in with releases)
- Mapbox access token (https://www.mapbox.com/)
